03/12/21 - Ideas about what's needed
1. Main Page / Home page  
    a. Header will include an add to library button that drops down the form to add a post, every page should have this.  
    b. Stretch goal (a search function)   
2. List of Categories Page
    a. Could potentially combine with Home Page  
    b. list of categories are as follows so far  
        1. Fakemon (Fan Creations)  
        2. Unreleased (Beta Pokemon, usually offial)  
        3. Redesigns (Reimaginings of official pokemon)  
        4. Fake Mega Evolutions (Fan made Mega's)  
        5. Extra/Alt Evolutions (Fan made but related to offical pokemon)  
        6. Predictions (Fan Imaginings usually of as yet released Pokemon)  
        7. Fusion (Combining of more than 2 pokemon)  
        8. Crossbreeds (Reskins based off of other pokemon, one is a dominant type the other is a skin)  
        9. Variants (reskins or species variations)  
        10. Regional (Fan imaginings to typeswapping and region variations Like the Alola region variants)  
        11. Crossover (Involving another IP)  
        12. Gijinka (Human clothing styled after Pokemon)  
        13. Reverse Gijinka (Weapons styled after Pokemon)  
        14. Mecha (Robots Styled after pokemon)  
        15. Stylized (Highly Stylized Fanart to the point of almost being redesigns)  
    b.1 Each listing of categories should include  
        1. Title of category  
        2. Random Image or last uploaded  
        3. link to list page of corresponding category  
3. Entries in Category Catalog Page
    a. list of all entries in category, show 50 per page because infinite scrolling is a dark pattern that causes problems.    
    b. show how many pages of entries exist at bottom and top of page.   
    c. Stretch goal (have a way to sort by name, type, artist name, date added, evolution group, etc)  
4. Individual Entries Page
    a. Form will need to include categories for...  
        1. ID #  
        2. Name  
        3. Image  
        4. Artist Name (can default to Unknown)  
        5. Related to (link to other fakemon or real ones, can default to N/A)  
        6. Source Link (can default to unknown)  
        7. Game Appearances (If Any)  
        8. Class (Enum of Above Categories)  
        9. Bio (Blurb about it)  
    b. Ideally it should allow for others to edit entries and keep track of who last edited it.   

03/15/21 - Wireframe and boilerplate
1. Start project, boilerplate
2. import as much as possible from Twitter project, begin to modify
3. Wireframe sketches on InvisionApp
4. Look into deploying on Heroku

03/16/21 (ToDo)
1. working prototype without styling
2. upload a few entries, try to keep permanence of them
